# FnFSS2PNG
Converts a Friday Night Funkin' Spritesheet to a collection of image sequences. Each seperate animation will be outputted to its own folder.

## How do I use this thing?
When running this program, it will prompt you to load your PNG/XML spritesheet. For the spritesheet you want to target, the PNG and XML file of it **must** be in the same folder.
As obvious, select your PNG/XML (it doesn't matter which one), and it will generate a folder in the same directory of the PNG/XML with folders containing image sequences of each animation.

### Important!
Currently, this program will only export
- The first 20 frames of any arrow animation
- The first 40 frames of all animations but the above
