# FnFSS2PNG
Converts a Friday Night Funkin' Spritesheet to a collection of image sequences. Each seperate animation will be outputted to its own folder.

## How do I use this thing?
When running this program, it will prompt you to load your PNG/XML spritesheet. For the spritesheet you want to target, the PNG and XML file of it **must** be in the same folder.
As obvious, select your PNG/XML (it doesn't matter which one), and it will generate a folder in the same directory of the PNG/XML with folders containing image sequences of each animation.

### Important!
Currently, this program will only export
- The first 20 frames of any arrow animation (contains, to lower case "left", "down", "up", "right")
- The first 40 frames of any idle animation (contains, to lower case "idle")
- The first 99 frames of all other animations

### Also important!
The only way to close this program (unless it closes itself, e.g. when it is done converting it will exit) is by opening up task manager and closing it through that method.

## Very cool, but how do I make GIFs with this thing?
Google "EzGif PNG sequence to gif" I swear it works exactly how you think it does (remember to adjust the fps though by setting the speed)

## To do list:
Add a branch which allows usage of the command line prompt to make changing export frame limits customizable
